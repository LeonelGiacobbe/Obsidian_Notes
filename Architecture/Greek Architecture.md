## ==Traits of Greek Architecture==

- United by language
- Founded on private property, individual freedom (less than 35%), “democracy”.
- Colonnade: series of columns supporting one side of a roof structure and an entablature.
- Built temples to house Gods and impress non-Greeks
    - Vivid colors, able to be seen from a great distance.
- Three orders of columns:
    - Metope:
        - Any of the panels, could be decorated or plain. Between triglyphs on a Doric Frieze
        - Triglyph: vertical blocks separating metopes on a frieze.
    - Doric:
        - Parthenon
        - Oldest, simplest, biggest. Considered “male” order.
        - Columns placed close together with no bases
        - Plain capitals
        - Have entablatures with metopes and triglyphs
    - Ionic:
        - Developed in Ionian islands
        - Delicate / female order
        - Used for interiors and smaller buildings
        - Easily recognizable by Volutes on Capital.
    - Corinthian:
        - Variation of Ionic. New type of capital (top of column)
        - Often found in interiors
        - Capital is decorated with leaves.
- Entasis: slight convex bulge given to a column to offset the optical illusion that it is thinner in the middle.
