## Principles of structures

- Forces on architecture:
    - Vertical:
        - Dead loads: forces from immovable objects in a building (walls, floors, etc)
        - Live loads: forces from movable objects in a building (people, furniture, etc)
- Resistance to forces:
    
    - Compression: capacity to resist being pushed together
    - Tension: capacity to resist being pulled apart
    
      
    

  

## Characteristics of building materials

- Steel
    - Weak against fire
    - Can be use for tension cables inside concrete to make it stronger

  

## Structural systems and construction types

- Frame trabeated
    - Wood
    - Steel
        - tall buildings
        - light weight
        - thin walls
- Masonry arcuated
    - Brick
    - Concrete
    - Stone
        - Heavy
        - Thick
        - Good insulation but costly

## How the WTC structure failed

- Planes crash into buildings, destroy many outer columns, some inner columns. Building still up
- Fire erupts and is spread by jet fuel
- Temperatures reach 1600F, weakening steel columns. Interior columns melt and collapse
- Added weight of collapsed floor causes pancaking effect (progressive collapse), buildings come down.

## Design for new buildings after WTC

- Winning design: freedom tower
- 1776 feet tall to honor independence year
