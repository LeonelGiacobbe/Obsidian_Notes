A group of sentences we use to convince someone about another group of sentences.

### Types of arguments
- _Inductive_: If all my sentences are true, then the thing I am trying to convince you of is probably true.
- _Deductive_: if you put true information in, you are guaranteed to get true information out
### Composition of arguments
1. _Premise_: facts stated at the beginning of an argument
		_Indicators_: since, because, given that, etc.
2. _Conclusion_: stated at the end of an argument. If you believe the premise to be true, then the conclusion will be true as well.
		_Indicators_: therefore, hence, thus. then, so, etc.
		
### How an argument can be weak

1.  One or more of the premises is wrong
2. Premises fail to support the conclusion. 

### Validity of an argument
An argument is deductively valid if it is impossible for the conclusion to be false while the premises are true. 
This does not mean that a deductively valid argument *has* to have true premises and conclusions, it just needs to follow the rule above.
Validity has nothing to due with the actual truth of the argument being made, it just means the premises and conclusion are logically compatible (see [[Logic]])
- Join all your premises with conjunction `&` and connect it to your conclusion with a conditional $\rightarrow$ . If the conditional is a tautology, then the argument is valid.

### Inductive Arguments
- Generalize many cases to make a universal assumption about all cases
- Inductive arguments are not deductively valid
