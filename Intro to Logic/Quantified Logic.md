### Application examples
P : ___ is a professor
D : ___ is a Duck
s : Seth

---------
a: Amos

c: Cleo 
-
Zx: ___ lives at the zoo
Rx: ___ is a reptile
Ax: ___ is an alligator
Lxy: ___ loves ___

(Za & Zb) & Zc ---> Amos, Bouncer and Cleo all live at the zoo
(Rb & $\neg$ Ab) --> Bouncer is a reptile but not an alligator
Lcb -> Mb --> If Cleo loves Bouncer then Bouncer is a monkey
$\exists$m(Rm & Zm) --> There is a reptile that lives at the zoo
$\forall$x(Ax -> Rx)
