- Autonomous vehicles
- Autonomous driver system is modular and can be integrated into many vehicles. I did a similar thing while working on Rc car project (ros2 package that can be used by anybody with a moving vehicle, a gps, and a lidar/camera)

### MOTION PLANNING & PREDICTION OR SIMULATION
### MY SKILLS
- Exp with Fast solving of bugs. Might be notified of bugs while researchers on field, so it is crucial to solve them ASAP. That will happen at KODIAK and I am ready to face that pressure.
- Experience writing production level code in C++ and Python. Top to bottom autonomy of vehicle:
	- Sensor fusion
	- Path planning & object avoidance
	- Safety fallbacks
- High comfortability with path-planning and motion algorithms, including A*
- I have experience with mapping autonomous systems for a wide variety of environments (both indoors and outdoors, dirt, etc).
- Since I used a stereo camera at work, we were able to keep the 3d pointcloud to execute a reconstruction of the environment, which is useful to the people using the robot, as well as compressing the readings into a 2d CostMap, which is used for mapping and course trajectory calculations
