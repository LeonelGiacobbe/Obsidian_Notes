## Reference frames

There are 3 main reference frames within a simulation:

- Map frame: rigid, never changes
- Base frame: could be considered as the axis of the chassis of the robot. May not be aligned with map reference **(REALLY IMPORTANT TO TAKE THIS INTO ACCOUNT)**
- LIDAR frame: frame of reference of the sensorâ€™s laser. Frame that will be used the most

  

Odometry: not exactly a reference frame itself; it represents relationship between different frames
