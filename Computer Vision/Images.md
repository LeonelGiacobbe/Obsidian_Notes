### Composition
- A function `f(x,y)` where `x` and `y` are spatial coordinates, and the amplitude of `f` at any coordinate is known as its intensity
	- in `f(x,y) = A`, `x` and `y` are the coordinates (row and column) and `A` is considered the intensity value
- 

### Digital Images
- Images with finite `f` values with infinite ranges for `x` and `y`
