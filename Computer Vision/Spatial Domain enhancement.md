Method of [[Image Enhancement]]
- Use a 2-dimension image plane
	- Manipulation directly on pixels
	- `g(x,y) = T[f(f,y)]`
	- `f` is input image, `g` is output image
	- `T` is the operator on `f`
	- `(x,y)`pixel has a neighborhood, a set of surrounding pixels around a center.
		- if the neighborhood is `1x1`, then it's a gray-level transformation
			- Leads to `Point Processing`, which only depends on the gray-level at that point
	- Applies transformation using a mask or template that transforms a pixel based on its surrounding neighborhood
### Contrast stretching
- Improves the contrast on an image by stretching the range of intensity values
- Typically done using a Linear Scaling Function, although logarithmic and power-law functions are also common
- `r` is the input intensity value, `s` is the transformation pixel, defined by `s = T(r)`
	- The negative of an image is defined by `s = L - 1 - r`, where `L-1` is the gray-level range 
	- For logarithmic transformations `s = c log (1 + r)`, where `c` is an arbitrary constant
	- Power transformations => `s = cr^y`, where `c` and `y`are constants >= 0
		- Bigger `y` values lead to darker images
		- Gamma correlation helps reduce the darkness generated by improving the quality of an image.
	- Piece wise linear transformations: can highlight a specific range of gray-level in an image
### Bit-plane slicing
- Decomposes an image into different planes, using bits instead of gray-level values.
- Bit plane 7 contains the most significant bits for higher intensities
- Bit plane 0 contains the least significant bits for lower intensities.
