- Light rays converge on retina. 
- They are converted to electrical signals in the eye.

### Acquisition of images
- Generated by an illumination source and the absorption of energy by the elements of a scene being imaged
- _Imaging sensors_ are used to transform that energy into a digital image (see [[Digital Image Processing]] for more)
	- Transforms incoming energy into voltage, forming a wave of energy that determines the image to be
	- These sensors can be _Array_ or _Line_ based

### Line Sensors
- Sensor moves across object to capture one line at a time. Each line is reconstructed to form an image
