- Light rays converge on retina. 
- They are converted to electrical signals in the eye.

### Acquisition of images
- Generated by an illumination source and the absorption of energy by the elements of a scene being imaged
- _Imaging sensors_ are used to transform that energy into a digital image
	- Transforms incoming energy into voltage, forming a wave of energy that determines the image to be
