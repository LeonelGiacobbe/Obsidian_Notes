- Given a continuous image, we need to digitize the coordinate values (see [[Digital Image Processing]])). 
- While sampling, we take a series of snapshots about a line and transform it into discrete values (maybe intensity in an n-bit range).
	- After sampling, quantization rounds the discrete values mentioned above

> These processes lower the quality of images

### Sampling
- main factor determining the spatial resolution of an image
- maintains the bit depth of an image but lowers the resolution by decreasing its size


### Quantization
- main factor determining the gray-level resolution of an image (bit depth)
