Conjunction operator: - ^,asterisk _, &_. - P ^ Q is read  
as P and Q - Only true if all propositions are true.  

Disjunction operator: - V, +, | - P V Q is read as P or Q - True when  
at least one proposition is true.  

Xor: - ⊕ - P ⊕ Q is read as P exclusive or Q - True when propositions  
are different  

Negation: - ¬ - Flips value - Unary

### Conditional and biconditional operators

- Denoted by ->
- Read as if P then Q or P implies Q
- independent propositions

Biconditional Operation: - If and only if, or if - Denoted by  
<-> - True only when inputs are the same  

### Laws to remember

- Idempotent
- Associative
- Distributive
- Double negation
- De Morgan’s
- Conditional identities

## De Morgan’s law

Distributes a negation inside a parenthesized expression. Also  
changes  
`AND` and `OR`.
