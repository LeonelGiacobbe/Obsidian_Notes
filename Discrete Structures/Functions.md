A functions maps an element of a set X to an element of a set Y. Each element of A must match with only one element in Y. However, different elements in X can point to the same element in Y. (see [[Set Logic]])

### ==Function Properties==

For `f: x → y`. Set X is referred to as the `domain` of f and set Y is referred to as the `target` of f.

The `range` of a function is a subset of the `target` of said function that includes all values inside of the target that have actually been mapped to a value in the domain. They’re not always equal to each other.

`Ceiling functions`: denoted as $\lceil x \rceil$﻿

`Floor functions`: denoted as $\lfloor x \rfloor$﻿

A function is `injective` or one-to one if $x \neq y$﻿ implies $f(x) \neq f(y)$﻿. This implies that $|D| \leq |T|$﻿

A function is onto or `surjective` if the range of f is equal to the target (every element of the range is mapped to something else). This implies that $|D| \geq |T|$﻿

A function is `bijective` if it’s both onto and one-to-one. This implies that $|D| = |T|$
