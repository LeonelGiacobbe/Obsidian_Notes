Universal proofs: are true for all numbers in the domain

Existential proofs: are true for at least one number in the  
domain.  

### Proof by exhaustion

```Plain
Proving something true by checking all possibilities individually.
```

### Disproving existential statements

- Can be achieved with De Morgan’s Laws (see[[Propositional Logic]]).  
    Goes from proving an existential statement false to proving an universal  
    one true (requires one counterexample)  
    

### Types of proofs

- _Direct proofs_: hyp assumed to be true, and conclusion is  
    proven as result of the assumption.  
    
- _Contrapositive_: proofs that p -> c by proving ¬p ->  
    ¬c. Assume the opposite of the conclusion and show how it leads to the  
    opposite of the hypothesis.  
    
- _Contradiction_: assume theorem is false, then show that  
    assumption leads to some logical inconsistency.  
    
- _Cases_: breaks domain into different sections and proves  
    each section.
