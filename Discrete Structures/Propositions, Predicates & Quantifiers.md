P(X) is a predicate where X is the variable. Domains restrict the  
possibility of values for a variable. Quantifiers can turn predicates  
into propositions  

### Predicates

A logical statement whose final value (true or false) depends on one  
or more variables. The end value of this statement is unknown until we  
know the value of the variables involved. When all the variables are  
accounted for, a predicate turns into a proposition. A predicate could  
be:  
_X is a prime number_. We don’t know the value of the  
predicate because we don’t know the value of X.  

### Propositions

A proposition is a statement that combines one or more variables (of  
which the true/false values are known), within a given domain, and  
states the end value of the statement. A proposition could be:  

_5 is  
a prime number  
_

. Now we know that X = 5, so we can assign the ‘True’  
value to the proposition.  

## Universal quantifier

`∀` is a universal quantifier. `∀ p(X)` means  
that p(x) is true for every possible value of X. One counterexample is  
enough to prove it false. Easier to prove  
`FALSE`

## Existential quantifier

`Ǝ` is an existential quantifier. `Ǝ P(X)`means  
there exists at least one X for which P(X) is true in the domain. One  
example is enough to prove it true. Easier to prove  
  
`TRUE`

To transform a predicate into a proposition, a quantifier and a  
domain is needed. (see
