==functionally complete:== any Boolean expression that can be expressed using only operations from the set.

Using `nand` , `nor` and DeMorgan’s law we can transform multiplication into addition. `nand` and `nor`are both functionally complete, so we can create any Boolean expression using just `nand` gates.

`nand`:$\neg(x * y)$﻿

`nor`: $\neg(x+y)$
