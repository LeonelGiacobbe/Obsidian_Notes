## Finite State Machines (FSM)

- Machine with a finite set of states
- Transition between states triggered by different input actions.
- Can be used to determine whether an input string has a particular property.
- Accepting state (drawn on a graph as a double circle): input looks to take the FSM to the accepting state.
- Fall short in even very simple computational tasks, so they are not commonly used.

  

## Turing Machines

- Church-Turing conjecture: any computational problem that can be solved on a current chip can be solved on a Turing machine.
- A language must be Turing-complete to be considered a programming language.
- Components:
    - Memory (one dimensional tape)
    - Input
    - State (done computing or still computing).
