- Consists of a pair of [[Set Logic]]`(V,E)` where `V` is a set of vertices and `E` is a [[Set Logic]]of edges
- In _undirected_ graphs, we donâ€™t care about the orientation of the graph itself, we just know if two vertices are connected or not.
- In _directed_ graphs, we know edges are connected but we also know the direction of the connection (like parent vertices and child vertices).

## ==Terminology==

- ==degree==: total number of neighbors for a vertex
- ==total degree:== sum of degrees of all vertices
- ==Regular graphs:== all vertices have the same degree.
- ==Subgraph==: a portion of a graph smaller than or equal to the parent graph.

  

## ==Adjacency List==

- way to visualize relationships between vertices (can be directed or undirected).

## ==Adjacency Matrix==

- Rows of the matrix represent current vertex and columns show the relationships of that vertex

- 1 means `True` (there is a connection). 0 means `False` (there is no connection).

  

## Graph Connectivity

- Graph Walks: traversing from one vertex to another.
    - _Length_ is number of edges on a walk
    - _Trail_: walk where no edge occurs more than once
    - _Path_: walk where no vertex occurs more than once
    - _Circuit_: closed trail
    - _Cycle_: both circuit and path
- K-Connectivity:
    - k-vertex-connected: graph contains at least `k+1` vertices and remains connected after any `k-1` vertices are removed
    - k-edge-connected: if removing any `k-1` or fewer edges results in a connected graph
