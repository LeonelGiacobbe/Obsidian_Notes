- base case: establishes theorem is true for first value in sequence
- Inductive step: if the theorem is true for _k_, then the theorem also holds for _k+1_.

  

## ==Inductive hypothesis==

_s(k) implies s(k+1)_ leads to s(i) being true. That is the inductive step.

  

## ==Strong induction==

Assumes that fact to be proven is true for all values less than _k_ and then proves that the fact also holds for _k+1_.

Base case: S(n) holds for n=a through b.

Inductive step: if S(n) is true then S(j) holds for j â‰¥ b.

Different from weak induction in that weak induction only assumes from _n_ forward, whereas strong induction proves S(n) holds from 1 to n to prove S(n+1)
