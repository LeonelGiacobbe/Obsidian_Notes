comparar con equipo olimpico

ironia de que la escuela debe promover act intelectuales pero me dejaron en banda

allowed for personal growth as I learned how to be my own teacher.

was tough because my mom had to move away in the middle of the qualifying rounds.

My excellent performance in the olympiads showed me that I can accomplish things that are far beyond my goals.

Instead of studying for the olympiad in school I joined an independent math club. Was the best decision bc everyone was passionate about it, and they werent coerced into the olympiad by the school

I understood that I am far more self-reliable than I realized. The experience thaught me self-accountability (my teacher at the club did not assign hw with deadlines, I had to set them for myself).

Fueled my passion for mathematics which allowed me to then explore further into machine learning and art generation (which uses many concepts and functions that I learned while preparing for the olympiad)

If a school prides itself in the educational opportunities and resources they provide, you never expect them to turn down the request from students to form a Math Club to prepare for a Math Olympiad. That is exactly what happened to me. At that point, my whole world came down. How was I supposed to prepare for a high-level Olympiad without any professional help. The search for a way to prepare for the competition independently changed my life in an unimaginable way.

It was a rainy Thursday afternoon. I was going through my checklist of theorems to memorize for the Argentinian Math Olympiad. Right there, near the end of the list, stood Menelaus’ Theorem. That theorem, which relates the ratios obtained by a line cutting the sides of a triangle, put an end to one of the best experiences of my life: participating in the Argentinian Math Olympiad. In spite of my dislike of geometry (and especially that theorem), my participation in the Argentinian Mathematical Olympiads changed my life in many great ways.

After my school refused to help me prepare for the Olympiads, I had to independently research and learn the formulas and concepts necessary to participate. While this process was really tiring, it also taught me very valuable things about myself. I had to learn to be my own teacher, trying to understand and solve complex problems all by myself. This tested my persistence and determination, and I had to fight really hard to stay motivated. It felt unfair watching all the other kids discuss and learn from their professors, while I had to rely on myself for my training.

Studying by myself started to become too much for me, especially with geometry (the subject that troubled me the most). After much thought, I decided to join an independent Math Club, and I became good friends with people who shared the same love and passion for mathematics as me. This fueled my passion for mathematics which allowed me to then explore further into Machine Learning and Art Generation (which use many concepts and functions that I learned while preparing for the olympiad).

The process of generating art through Algorithms and Artificial Intelligence brought an unexpected joy to me. I have always loved drawing, painting, and expressing myself through art, but there is something about the way I build these artworks that is especially satisfying to me. Maybe it is the fact that, two years ago, I did not even know what programming was, and now I am able to express myself freely utilizing computer programs.

In spite of the many things that came out of my participation in the Olympiads, it did not come without its hardships. Preparing for the Competition without my school’s help meant lots of time spent researching theory and developing strategies for test day. In addition, my mom had to move to another country in the middle of the qualifying rounds to pursue professional opportunities. This was by far the toughest challenge I had to face during the whole process. Without her, I had to juggle between schoolwork, taking care of my brother, and preparing for the olympiad.

My performance in the olympiads showed me that I can accomplish things that are far beyond my goals. In spite of the many obstacles that were put in my way, I was able to reach the Finals of the Argentinian Math Olympiad. I was one correct answer away from being prized as one of the top performers in the competition. I answered the fifth problem wrong. That problem was centered around Menelau’s theorem.

While I’m proud of my performance in the olympiad, I whole-heartedly believe that what I learned about myself during the time I spent preparing for the competition is far more valuable than me reaching the finals. Participating in the olympiad fueled my passion for mathematics which later allowed me to explore further into other aspects of STEM, mainly machine learning and art generation (which use many concepts and functions that I learned while preparing for the olympiad). It also taught me to believe in myself, and to always be the best version of myself.

My decision to dive into the Competitive Mathematics world brought clarity to my life and allowed me to pinpoint what my passions and goals are.

I just hope that, wherever my life leads me, I will not have to use Menelaus’ Theorem.
