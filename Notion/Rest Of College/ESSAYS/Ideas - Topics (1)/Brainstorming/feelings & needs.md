**effects**

1) not talking to friends as often, having to adapt to different lifestyle

2) random spurts where motivation to be in better shape is really high or almost non existent. inconsistency in how I view myself

3) people may think I dont like them when I do but im just shy.

**feelings**

1) ambivalent. like living there but miss family & friends. wish I was living in the US but with fr&fa here. vulenerable, grateful, anxious

2) miss track of how my body is looking, sometimes I think im too fat and other times I do not. detached, ashamed, guilty

3) makes me sad when I see others easily making friends, chamuyando, and I dont know how to do any of that. downhearted, feeling como que sobro in some situations.

need

1) anxious: predictability. Did not know what to expect. Life could have been very different and I would have no way of knowing. Real life in the U.S. is very different from movies, sometimes in a good and other times in a bad way.

2) Detached: growth. Started consistently losing weight, lost too much weight, tried to put on some more weight, and put on too much. My dedication comes in bursts, and I gotta work for it to be more consistent.

3) downhearted: sexuality. never felt really attracted to someone. Obviously I find some girls really hot, but not in an “Im in love with you” way. Never felt that, and its looking like I wont anytime soon.

**What I did about it**

1) asked for help to lots of people (ex counselor, classmates, etc).

2) became knowledgable about dieting & exercise theory. Really enjoyed the process of learning about it, and sometimes, doing it.

3) was more talkative and open in discord calls. through games I stopped being too shy & developed meaningful relationships more easily.

**What I learned**

1) developed adaptabilty, greater english skills (especially listening), learned about job atmosphere, made english speaking friends

2) learned about diets & exercises. got a clear path to a healthier lifestyle

3) learned that im just not a really sociable person (which is fine). that realisation influenced my decision to accept moving to the u.s. and also influenced my career choice as a programmer, since its a job that doesnt require a lot of talking
