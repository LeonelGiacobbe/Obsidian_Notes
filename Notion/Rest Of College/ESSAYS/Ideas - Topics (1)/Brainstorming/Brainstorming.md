If you really knew me…

youd know im really struggling with procrastination. I know how important it is for me to succeed in the future but at the same time I cannot find the motivation or will to get off my ass and work. It is not stress, I am not tired, i just dont do what I need to do.

youd know that i do not want to let my family down, and it breaks my heart when they go out of their way to help me do homework or be quiet, and they dont know im actually watching a series or youtube video.

I love…

I love my family

when im right.

when I get something right the first time.

when no one bothers me

when i get in the flow zone and actually enjoy the things I “need” to do (say homework, essays, etc)

talking to myself

working alone as in no company, but talking to myself w conversations, which allows me to think better

I’m grateful for…

the support of my family, especially my mother

all the hardships i have overcome

the fact that I accepted coming to the us

the fact that I have achieved numerous things w/o other people’s help (for the most part)

**WHAT DO I VALUE**

personal dev, self love, freedom, stability, truth, family, success, health, independence, friendships

family, personal dev, self love, freedom, friendships

personal dev, family, friendships

personal dev → meaningful bc I know I can be a better version of myself than I currently am, but I do not always work towards becoming better. I’ve got to stay persistent, and I know every moment spent developing myself i gonna pay off in the long run. It manifests in my life with my gym commmitment, my performance at work, and the process of applying to college.
