ideas

talk about stereotypes of the u.s. how they are true but also unexpectedly challenging to get used to. start raw mentioning those stereotypes

  

slushies, greasy popcorn, bullies, school? advertisements?

to a foreign person, it seems like you’d know perfectly what life in the us is like due to pop culture, social media, etc. but that is far from the truth.

  

no one tells you about… every trip to the doc is more than 100$, people are not as socially interactive as in argentina

  

while the move and adaptation was much harder than expected, it benefited me bc

  

allowed me to improve english, qualify for mathcon, allowed me to become more comfortable with the unknown and less fearful of being out of my comfort zone

**Challenges**

moving to the u.s, being apart from my father bc of his work, senior year not feeling really special,

  

**Effects**

not talking to friends as often, having to adapt to different lifestyle, being cautious with money in case an emergency happens, not being able to communicate with my grandparents very often, had to help my brother become comfortable with english as he had only started speaking it 1 year before we moved. had to adapt to school in english

  

**what I did about it**

took a job and got a promotion 3 months later, utilized resources from my school to get great grades and qualify for mathcon, learned how to ask for help and not feel embarassed about it, took the oppotunity to teach and share my culture with local students, had to juggle between doing homework, preparing for college, helping my brother, completing documents and visas. Became my own teacher and the first student of my school to qualify for a national level math competition.

  

What I learned

I learned I have great adaptability skills, that my culture is really interesting to people, which encouraged me to tell them about my country. Some students even took up some traditions and bake some food from arg. I learned that asking for help is not a sign of weakness. it is a sign of determination and commitment.

One random thrusday night, my parents told us to come to the living room, not telling us why. I did know what to expect. Was I going to have a new sibling? After all, this is the same way my parents told me they were expecting a baby in 2013. My head quickly turned towards a much darker option. Had any family member died? In actuality, my parents told my siblings and I about the biggest change in our lives. In six months’ time, we would be moving to the U.S. was very good thing, but lots of challenges. As soon as my plane landed in my new home country I realised things would be much harder than anticipated. And they were.

  

When people think about life in the U.S. they think “fast food, slushies, athletes & cheerleaders, industrialization and capitalism, etc”. While these are mostly true, they do not paint the whole picture of how living in the U.S. is like, and I had to learn that the hard way. Even though I had always thought of myself as someone who did not become too attached to people, being away from my friends and family took a toll on me. Making new friends was also challenging, partly due to the language barrier.
