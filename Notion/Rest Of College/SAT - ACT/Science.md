**Environmental Science, Ecology, and Geology:**

Atmosphere/gases:

_Layers of the atmosphere (from lowest to highest):_

- Troposphere: contains breathable air.
- Stratosphere: contains the ozone layer, which absorbs most of the UV radiation from the sun and turns it into heat.
- Mesosphere: coldest layer of the atmosphere.
- Thermosphere: contains low density air and can ve bery hot.
- Exosphere: where molecules escape into space.

_Greenhouse gases:_ such as carbon dioxide. They trap radiation and contribute to the greenhouse effect.

_Acid rain:_ made acidic through pollution

Global warming: process where the earth's temperature rises due to gases and pollution. Leads to climactic catastrophes.
