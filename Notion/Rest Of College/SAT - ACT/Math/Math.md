To find a slope, with (x1,y1) and (x2,y2), where the slope is "m".

m=(y2-y1)/(x2-x1). It doesn't matter which points we choose as 1 and 2.

Two lines on the X,Y plane are paralel if they have the same slope. When the equation is written as y=mx+b, "m" is the slope. "m" has to be equal in both equations, and "b" different. For example, y=mx+b and y=mx+c are paralel.

The median of a set of numbers, is the one that is in the middle, when the set is ordered from smallest to largest. The mode is the number that shows up in the list more frequently. The mean of average if the sum of the numbers divided by the amount of numbers.

---

Two perpendicular lines have slopes that are negative reciprocals. So if the first slope is m, the second one has to be -1/m, so the lines are perpendicular
