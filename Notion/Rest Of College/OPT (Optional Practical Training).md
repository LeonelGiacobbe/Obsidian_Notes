Types of OPT:

- Pre-completion OPT: You may apply to participate in pre-completion OPT after you have been lawfully enrolled on a full-time basis for one full academic year at a college, university, conservatory, or seminary. If you are authorized to participate in pre-completion OPT, you may work part time (20 hours or less per week) while school is in session. You may work full time when school is not in session.
- Post-completion OPT: You may apply to participate in post-completion OPT after completing your studies. If you are authorized for post-completion OPT, you may work part time (20 hours or less per week) or full time.
- STEM OPT Extension: you may qualify for a 24-month extension of your post-completion OPT employment if:
    - You are an F-1 student who received a STEM degree
    - Are employed by an employer who is enrolled in and is using E-Verify
    - Received an initial grant of post-completion OPT employment authorization based on your STEM degree.

### **Applying to OPT:  
  
**

Request that your designated school official (DSO) at your academic institution recommend the OPT. Your DSO will make the recommendation by endorsing your Form Iâ€‘20.

Properly file Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization with USCIS, accompanied by the required fee and the supporting documentation as described in the form instructions.

If you are applying from a STEM degree:

- Pre-completion OPT: Must apply after your Designated School Official enters the recommendation for OPT into your SEVIS record. May apply up to 90 days before you complete a full academic year, as long as you do not start OPT employment until you complete one full academic year.
- Post-completion OPT: Must apply within 30 days of your Designated School Official entering the recommendation for OPT into your SEVIS record. May apply up to 90 days before you complete your degree, but no later than 60 days after you complete your degree.
- STEM OPT Extension: Must apply within 60 days of your Designated School Official entering the recommendation for OPT into your SEVIS record. May apply up to 90 days before your current OPT employment authorization expires.

If you are an F-1 student with a timely filed H-1B petition and change of status request, and your F-1 status and employment authorization will expire before the change of status to H-1B occurs (typically Oct. 1), you may be eligible for a cap-gap extension.
