Idea for college essay: write about how santi became my best friend, and without knowing, helped me realise the value of friendships and close relationships. he helped me be myself.

helps the admissions officers understand the education program. 1-1.5 pages (3-4 paragraphs). It is better to show growth in the letters, not only get letters from people that give you only A's. It is better if the letters of recommendations are different. Do not go overboard with the amount
