if something cant go on forever, it wont. → Herbert Stein

fifteen thousand years ago, everyone was a hunter-gatherer

Understanding how we have changed from the past to now is the key to understanding the reason why we will change in the future.

  

In trying to reach one thing, organisms reach a tipping point and become something totally different. That is called emergent phenomena. Evolution always tries to make us the best at one thing.

  
Author argues there have been 4 tipping points already, and we are currently in the fifth one.  

  

Primary driver of those beginnnings is increased competititon through lack of resources. Altruism and cooperation are also essential.

  

Fifth beginning may bring more cooperation than competition.

  

Many hunter-gatherers hunted species to extinction.

It’s the end of war as a viable way to resolve disputes, the end of the nation-state and capitalism as sacred organizational and economic forms, and the beginning of global citizenship.

Maya beginning of time and of the Long Count: August 11,  
3114 b.c.  

  
Revitalization movements are those were a prophet claims the imminent end of the world and claims that people have to return to their original roots to have a chance at salvation  

Since 1980 inequality both within and between countries has increased dramatically. 62 richest people have the same wealth as bottom 3.5 billion of world population.

  

Most authors have a pessimistic view on society’s future, and think overpopulation and climate change are the main things to blame.

Optimistic ones point to the fact that violence is down, food availability is up, child mortality is down, and people living in poverty are less every day. Medicine, life expectancy, availability of information, have all gone up.

Chapter 2

  

without time machines, archaeologists cant be sure they are right. They have to rely on their best judgement.

  

Around 5100 years ago, we already used stone tools, had weapons like knives and bows, were omnivores, ate stone ground seeds and wheat. We also used copper

We find it easier to understand things when they are put in terms that make sense to us as individuals

  

optically stimulated luminescence

electon-spin resonance

Analysis of carbon, nitrogen, and strontium isotopes in human bone  
and teeth tell us what people ate and where they were born and raised  

Not all sites preserve DNA and archaeological information, and many have been cross-contaminated.

  

the Basketmaker period, runs from about 200 b.c. to a.d. 700, Pueblo I from a.d. 700 to 900, and Pueblo II from a.d. 900 to 1100.

The basketmaker period on southwest American history was a time when people user to live in semisubterranean pithouses, constructed incredible baskets, and did some pottery.

  

Archaeologists assume that a change in material remains signifies a change in human society’s architecture. They are not interested in the material remains, they are interested in what they mean and what they can tell us about humanity’s past.
