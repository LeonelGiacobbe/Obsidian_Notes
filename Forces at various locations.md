Choose one of the unknown locations and do the sum of torques there.

*Don't forget the weight of the structure*

### Example problem
Mass of horizontal beam is 280 kg, Find forces acting at Fa and Fb. Fa is left endpoint. Fb is right endpoint
4300N act down, 2m to the right of Fa
3100N act down, 6m to the right of Fa
2200N act down, 1m to the left of Fb
2744N Act down, 5m from Fa (Weight of the bridge)
- Sum of torques acting at one location (Point B)
- Get distances from that point
- (2200)(1m)+3100(4m)+2744(5m)+4300(8m)-Fa = 0
	- Fa is negative bc it points up, causing clockwise rotation (negative)
	- Solve for Fa, Fa = 6272N
- Sum of the forces in Y direction to find Fb
- Fa - 4300 - 2744 - 3100 - 2200 - Fb = 0. Fb = 6072


### Example Problem 2
Find force required in person's bicep
[[Bicep Hold Drawing]]
- Sum of torques
- Turn kg to N (times 9.8)
- (.05)Fm -(.15)(19.6)-(.35)(49) = 0
	- Fm = 402N

### Example Problem 3
[[Example Problem 12-3]]
- Find tension in green wire
- Uniform beam, so MG is at the middle
- Use point C for torque
- (-)(0.85)(135)+(1.35)(Fty)-1.7(215) = 0
- 1.35Ftsin(145) = 480.25, Ft = 620.2N
	- Pos / neg based on rotation orientation
- In X direction:
- Hx + Ftx = 0
- Hx + (620.2)cos145 = 0
- Hx = 508N
- In Y direction:
- Hy - 135 - 215 + Fty = 0
- Hy = -5.73 N
